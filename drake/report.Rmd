Run `make.R` to generate the output `report.pdf` and its dependencies. Because we use `loadd()` and `readd()` below, `drake` knows `report.pdf` depends on targets `fit`, and `hist`.

```{r content}
library(drake)
loadd(result_of_imported_function)
loadd(project_ended_on)
```

```{r}
result_of_imported_function
```

```{r}
project_ended_on
```
